# Welcome to FaceTag.AI

**FaceTag is a program that allows for admins to track users throughout a building's network of security cameras. The program records users' movements across multiple camera streams to provide real time locations of personel. The program is also able to be used with singular cameras to identify people at a check-in or ticket desk.**

## System Overview
### What's Inside?

The core FaceTag.AI program is only able to process a single video stream at a time. This means that in order to view all the streams in a camera, the main command program creates AWS instances for each camera which send the recognized data to the central MySQL database. This database is what is displayed on the UI home page.
